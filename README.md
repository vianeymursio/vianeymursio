### Hi there!

I'm Vianey, a 2nd-year Comp Sci major @ UC Irvine.  

I'm interested in gaining experience in web development, such as with front-end, full-stack, and UI/UX design.  
I was one of the latest contributors of [zot4plan](https://www.zot4plan.com) and currently hold the position of *webmaster* in [MAES](https://sites.uci.edu/maes/).
